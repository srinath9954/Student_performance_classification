# Student Performance Classification

This project aims to classify student performance based on various academic and behavioral attributes using multiple machine learning models. It evaluates different algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Perceptron, and MLP Classifier (Neural Network), to determine the most accurate predictor.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Implementation of multiple classification models
- Comparison of model accuracies
- User input for performance prediction

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as student marks, attendance, and other academic indicators. Categorical features are encoded, and irrelevant columns are removed during preprocessing.



## Usage
1. The script loads and preprocesses the dataset.
2. Trains multiple classification models.
3. Evaluates and compares accuracy.
4. Accepts user input to predict student performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of different models is compared based on accuracy and other evaluation metrics like precision and recall.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement hyperparameter tuning
- Add visualization for feature importance
- Deploy as a web-based tool using Flask/Django
